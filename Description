# Access-Based-System
The main aim of this project is to give safety at every commonplace like home, public places. This user would give a known password. The information will be stored in a database. When the correct passcode is entered, the microcontroller will give instructions to the DC motor. DC motor will perform the action on door unlocking. 

The need for safety can be achieved by making locks that can be electrical or mechanical with one or a few keys, but for locking a big area many locks are required. As everyone knows old fashioned locks are heavyweight and fragile also depending on the tools therefore electronic locks are given more value than those mechanical locks. Nowadays every deviceâ€™s operation is based on digital technology. For example, technology-based identity devices are used for automatic door unlocking or locking. These locking systems are used to control the movement of the door and are functional without requiring a key to lock or unlock the door. These locking systems are controlled by a keypad and are installed at the side hedge of the door. 
Here, we use the 4x4 keypad to enter the password if it matches the predefined password which is stored in the microcontroller the actuator gets actuated through the relay thus opening the lock. The microcontroller-based Door locker is an access control system that allows only authorized persons to access a restricted area. When someone tries to enter the restricted area by entering invalid passwords continuously, the system locks itself. Thus, what we want is digital technology to construct an integrated and well-customized safety system at a price that is reasonable.
