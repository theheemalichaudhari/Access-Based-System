Our project works on the principle of DC motor. We have programmed our  LPC2148 with a DC motor and motor driver. A direct current (DC) motor is a type of electric machine that converts electrical energy into mechanical energy. DC motors take electrical power through direct current and convert this energy into mechanical rotation. The DC motor moves the door to open and close and the motor driver drives the motor after receiving the code signals from the microcontroller. Motor Driver acts as an interface between the motors and the control circuits. Motor drivers are made from discrete components which are integrated inside an IC. The input to the motor driver IC or motor driver circuit is a low current signal. The function of the circuit is to convert the low current signal to a high current signal. This high current signal is then given to the motor. 

We have programmed our LPC2148 such that we get three chances to enter the correct password so as to have the access to our system. Once we enter the right password the LCD will display the lock opening and there would be green led blinking. For the wrong password, the buzzer will buzz.
